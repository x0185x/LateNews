She rose to international prominence in the late 1990s and early 2000s with two albums, Black Diamond and Mahogany Soul, that spawned a pair of popular singles, [No More Rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgG0Hu_FeiA) and Wish I Didn’t Miss You.

Eight further solo albums displayed Stone’s command not just of soul but of gospel, R&B and funk, often in collaboration with other songwriters and artists, including [Prince](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/22/prince-obituary) ([U Make My Sun Shine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8z-fQbYHyE), 2001), Snoop Dog ([I Wanna Thank Ya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHRtJm95R7o), 2004), Anthony Hamilton ([Stay for a While](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUgaas4h-lQ), 2004) and Betty Wright ([Baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXdn5mPESVU), 2007).
