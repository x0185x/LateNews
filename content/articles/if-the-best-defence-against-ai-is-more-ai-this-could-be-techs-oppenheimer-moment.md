An unsettling new book advocates a closer relationship between Silicon Valley and the US government to harness artificial intelligence in the name of national security

Oscar Wilde’s quip, “Life imitates art far more than art imitates life”, needs updating: replace “art” with “AI”.

And some of the initial funding came from the investment arm of – wait for it – the CIA!
