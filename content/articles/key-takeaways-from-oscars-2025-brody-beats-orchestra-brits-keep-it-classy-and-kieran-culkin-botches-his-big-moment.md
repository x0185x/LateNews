The awards ceremony can’t escape Harvey Weinstein and two fairytales come a cropper

  * **[Anora dominates the Oscars](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/mar/02/oscars-anora-picture-actress-mikey-madison-sean-baker) — here’s the [complete list of winners](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/mar/02/oscars-academy-awards-winners-live)**
