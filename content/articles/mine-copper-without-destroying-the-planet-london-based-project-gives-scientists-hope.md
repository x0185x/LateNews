Experts hope research can create greener methods of extracting the metal vital for renewable energy revolution and boom in electrical devices

It is the key ingredient of bronze, the alloy that helped create some of the worldâ€™s greatest civilisations and took humanity out of the stone age on its way to modern times. For good measure, the metal is invaluable for electrical wiring, plumbing and industrial machinery. We owe a lot to copper.

But the metal now faces an uncertain future as manufacturers prepare to expand its use to make the electric cars, renewable power plants and other devices that will help the planet move towards net zero. Unrestricted extraction could cause [widespread ecological devastation](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/09/copper-mining-reveals-clean-energy-dark-side), scientists have warned.
