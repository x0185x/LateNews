We did not realise our HSBC debit card had been linked to her iPhone and she was sending money to YouTube channels

**Our eight-year-old daughter has, unbeknown to us, managed to spend over £8,500 over 90 days on the Apple app store. We did not realise that our HSBC debit card had somehow been linked to her iPhone and had no idea that she could spend so easily. She was not aware that the money she was spending was real money.**

**She has been sending money to YouTube channels and the YouTubers have then befriended her on Roblox in an attempt to make more money****from our child. To me, this is financial grooming. HSBC did not once alert us to these suspicious transactions. Apple initially rejected our claim for a refund,****then, on appeal, agreed to refund only two payments totalling £60 because they were unauthorised purchases by a minor, even though the others were made in the same circumstances. We are desperate.**
