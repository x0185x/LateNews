In more than 70 documentaries, Stacey Dooley’s disarmingly light touch has taken her to the heart of many of society’s darkest issues. After 20 years of filming she thought she’d seen it all… Until she became a mother. 

The broadcaster Stacey Dooley gave birth to her daughter, Minnie, in January 2023. Though she has reported on women for almost two decades, she has been surprised by the transformations of motherhood. “I went into it so unprepared,” she says. “I cannot begin to tell you.” Like other soon-to-be parents, Dooley decided against attending antenatal classes and rejected manuals offered by friends. “You know, I used to see mums finding it tough and I’d think, ‘It can’t be _that_ hard.’ I really used to think that. Which is fucking hil _arious_. I owe all of those women an apology.”

Dooley and I are in a hotel café in Knightsbridge, west London, where she is later due to meet her accountant. She has written a book, _Dear Minnie_ , in which she profiles women who have had different experiences of conception, pregnancy and labour. Dooley’s own pregnancy was comparatively straightforward: some sickness, a scheduled C-section, though “the sleep deprivation knocked me for six,” she says. “I’ve never in my life been that tired.” In the book, Dooley describes the first six months of Minnie’s life as an overwhelm of struggle and vulnerability. “My living room looked like a teenager’s bedroom,” she writes. Her partner, the dancer [Kevin Clifton](https://www.instagram.com/keviclifton/?hl=en), with whom Dooley was coupled during the 2018 series of _Strictly Come Dancing_ , was given two weeks of paternity leave before being hauled back to work. (Clifton is currently appearing in a UK tour of [Chicago](https://chicagothemusical.com/uk-tour/).) “I remember him leaving and shutting the front door and being like, ‘What the hell am I going to do now?’” Dooley recalls. “And I felt envious. That he was going to be sleeping from 10pm to 8am. I remember feeling jealous of that.”
