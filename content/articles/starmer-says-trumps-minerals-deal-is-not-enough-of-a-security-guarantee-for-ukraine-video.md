The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, [said in parliament on Monday](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/mar/03/peter-mandelson-ukraine-donald-trump-volodymyr-zelenskyy-keir-starmer-uk-politics-live?filterKeyEvents=false&page=with%3Ablock-67c5d6b28f0837a34020603f#block-67c5d6b28f0837a34020603f) that Donald Trump’s proposed minerals deal would not provide a sufficient security guarantee for Ukraine. The Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, said Kyiv had agreed to sign a deal with the US and asked whether that would satisfy its security needs. Starmer replied: ‘The minerals deal is not enough on its own.’ He added: ‘Can I just remind him [Farage] that Russia is the aggressor, Zelenskyy is a wartime leader whose country has been invaded, and we should all be supporting him, not fawning over Putin’
