Wes Streeting is building a team of reformers, but ingrained weaknesses in the health service will be hard to fix

Speaking to MPs last week, Dr Penny Dash quoted the Guardian’s description of her as a [reforming zealot](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/feb/25/wes-streeting-to-axe-thousands-of-jobs-at-nhs-england-after-ousting-of-chief-executive). Dr Dash is less zealous than she used to be, she said, and better at listening. But the doctor and management consultant, who has just been appointed chair of NHS England, has lost none of her determination to make the health service better and more productive.

How this boost will be achieved is the multibillion-pound question. The upcoming [10-year plan](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/07/keir-starmer-nhs-plan-key-elements-will-it-succeed) is Wes Streeting’s chance to turn Labour’s manifesto pledges, and consistent poll lead on the NHS, into policies that could help his party win a second term.
