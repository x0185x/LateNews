Through a combination of soft and hard power, Europe must seek to ensure Kyiv has agency and a voice in peace negotiations

After last Friday’s disgraceful roughhouse [treatment](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/trump-zelenskyy-meeting-transcript) of Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the White House, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, delivered a pithy summary of first principles regarding the first full-scale war between nation states on European soil since 1945. “There is an aggressor: Russia,” Mr Macron [observed](https://x.com/EmmanuelMacron/status/1895582703556444404) on social media, “There is a victim: Ukraine. We were right to help Ukraine and sanction Russia three years ago – and to keep doing so.”

That this needed saying underlines the extent to which Donald Trump’s administration is laying waste to decades-old assumptions governing transatlantic relations. Appearing to prioritise a reset of the US relationship with Russia over international law and the unity of the west, Mr Trump is [pursuing](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/25/the-guardian-view-on-trumps-realignment-the-geopolitical-plates-are-moving-brace-for-further-shocks) a peace deal with Moscow on Vladimir Putin’s terms. At the same time he is seeking to plunder Ukraine’s [natural resources](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn527pz54neo), while demanding obeisance and gratitude from Kyiv in return.
