The world’s most admired democracy is being held hostage by a clique of far-right thugs. It would be a mistake to placate them

It’s not only about Donald Trump. It’s not just about [saving Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/mar/02/ukraine-war-volodymyr-zelenskyy-keir-starmer-donald-trump-us-europe-eu-russia-defence-latest-live-news), or defeating Russia, or how to boost Europe’s security, or what to do about an America gone rogue.
