Top tips on better batter, cooking techniques and cooling time, to ensure a reliable vegan yorkie every time

**I can never get my vegan yorkshire puddings to work – help!  
** Traditional yorkshire puddings have eggs and milk to thank for their golden, crisp and puffy looks, so it’s no wonder people run into bother in their absence. “Vegan yorkshires are a mighty task,” says Lianna Lee Davis, who is behind the much-lauded vegan Sunday roast at [Our Black Heart](https://www.ourblackheart.com/lds-kitchen) in Camden, London. Your first task is to decide on their replacements, and for that you have a few options. “I use [aquafaba](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/nov/17/vegan-aquafaba-recipe-bean-water-recipe-food-waste-tom-hunt) and whisk it with apple cider vinegar, rapeseed oil, dijon mustard, unsweetened soya milk and water,” she says. She then combines plain flour, chickpea flour, salt and turmeric (“for a bit of colour”), and whisks that into the wet mix to make a batter.

Marc Joseph, of [E3 Vegan](https://www.e3vegan.com/), meanwhile, prefers a combination of soya milk, baking powder and self-raising flour: “I’ve tried all sorts of things,” he says, “and baking powder gives the best results.” Once mixed with the flour and popped into a really hot oven, “they rise quickly like a cake at the start, so, by the time they’re cooked, you have really crisp edges”. That’s also Gaz Oakley’s preferred route. For 12 yorkshire puddings, the author of [Plant to Plate](https://guardianbookshop.com/plant-to-plate-9781837832927/), published in May, combines 260g self-raising flour, one and a half teaspoons of baking powder and a teaspoon of salt. “Add 480ml soya milk, whisk until smooth, then pour into a jug.” Just like the OG, vegan yorkies also benefit from a rest, Joseph says: “Make the batter at least 30 minutes before you want to use it.”
