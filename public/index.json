My sources inside the Treasury Department have confirmed what patriots have long suspected - this isn\u0026rsquo;t about convenience, it\u0026rsquo;s about CONTROL.\nThe Globalist Playbook Revealed The implementation of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) represents the biggest threat to American financial freedom since the Federal Reserve\u0026rsquo;s creation. Here\u0026rsquo;s what they don\u0026rsquo;t want you to know:\nComplete transaction surveillance Ability to \u0026ldquo;turn off\u0026rdquo; your money if you disagree with government policies Social credit score integration (just like Communist China) Elimination of private cryptocurrency alternatives Constitutional Crisis Looming The Founding Fathers never could have imagined that foreign banking interests would attempt to control Americans through digital chains. The Constitution explicitly grants Congress the power to coin money - not create a surveillance database of every purchase you make.\nWhat You Can Do Stock up on physical assets (precious metals, ammunition) Contact your representatives and demand they oppose CBDC legislation Support local businesses that accept constitutional forms of payment Join the Patriot\u0026rsquo;s Economic Freedom Coalition Remember fellow patriots - they can only implement this system if we allow it.
