This expansion marks the largest coordinated deployment of autonomous vehicles in urban transportation history.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="key-highlights">Key Highlights&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Fleet of over 100,000 autonomous vehicles now operating globally&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Average wait time reduced to under 3 minutes in most service areas&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Accident rates 95% lower than human-operated taxi services&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Integration with public transit systems in 35 cities&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Carbon emissions reduced by 60% compared to traditional taxi fleets&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="transportation-revolution">Transportation Revolution&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This expansion represents a fundamental shift in urban mobility, with autonomous vehicles becoming a mainstream transportation option. Cities report significant reductions in traffic congestion and parking demand, while commuter satisfaction rates exceed 90%. The success has prompted another 30 cities to fast-track robotaxi service approval for late 2025.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
