&lt;h2 id="key-highlights">Key Highlights&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Protein design completed in 1/10th of traditional development time&lt;/li>
&lt;li>95% effectiveness in preclinical trials&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Minimal side effects compared to existing treatments&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Novel binding mechanism targets cancer cells specifically&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stable at room temperature, improving accessibility&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="medical-impact">Medical Impact&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This breakthrough represents a new paradigm in drug discovery, combining AI capabilities with protein engineering to create more effective and targeted treatments. Clinical trials are scheduled to begin in major cancer centers worldwide within the next month.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
